i'm not sure what this will be just yet; i've tried starting a blog a few times in the past (furthest i ever got was back at linguistics nerd camp and the less said about that the better really)

i want to try to get down (in some cases merely marshall/organize) my thoughts on a few things and maybe even try my hand at some fiction
