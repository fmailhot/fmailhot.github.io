## who am i

i am fred. i am [somewhat online](https://twitter.com/fmailhot)

i'm currently an industry linguist (on an ASR team for a business telephony company); i started out planning to [head into academia](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=JjM_Ks4AAAAJ&hl=en) and it took me *way* too long (a full year of postdoc) to realize that it wasn't quite the right path for me. i sometimes still miss aspects of it; i enjoyed lecturing and the research bit of doing research, but in truth i'm kind of terrible at it all so it's probaby good that i ended up where i did. i have very occasional collaborators and somehow wound up getting a [co-authored thing](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4224/) into a compling workshop last summer, and (i honest had completely forgotten about this until just now namesearching myself) [contributing to an academic magazine](https://theamericanscholar.org/well-hey-there-search/).

i'm a divorced (re-married) dad of a 12yo girl. i play bass (or rather recently restarted; thanks pandemic). i like driving stick (and feel bad about having a car). i like beer (stouts porters and nut browns) and red wine (current faves are tuscan sangiovese and rioja tempranillo blends). i wish weed didn't put me to sleep.

## what is this

i mean it's a blog right? i have no clue (and make no promises) about how frequently content will appear, but i'll make a good faith effort to update semi-regularly (jeebus knows i've got enough opinions and love hearing myself talk).

i'll *probably* wind up talking about tech stuff, linguistics-y stuff, politics, parenting/family, random shit i see online, and hopefully trying to write some fiction once in a while (it's a thing i've always wanted to do)

## ok but why

honestly i don't really know...i've felt my brainpower waning over the past few years and this seems as good a time as any (maybe getting toward the closing of the temporal window really) to get at least some of what's in there "on paper"

## will you ever use capital letters again

maybe? the internet says all the cool kids don't do it anymore, and what is middle age, really, other than a struggle to continue being a cool kid...but i'll be damned if i stop using ellipses...
