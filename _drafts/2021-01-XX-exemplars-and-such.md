# memorization, analogy, and generalization in linguistic science
---

In _First Language, Vol. 40(5--6)_ Ambridge (2020) presents empirical and theoretical arguments for a "radical exemplar" approach to child language acquisition. He presents empirical and theoretical arguments --- across several linguistic subdomains --- in support of the explicit, detailed storage of linguistic tokens, and argues against the storage of abstractions.

As someone who's been interested in exemplar approaches to phonetics/phonology for several years (Mailhot 2010), my aim in this post is to go over Ambridge's main points, review a selection of the replies to his target article, and assess the effectiveness of the position he settles on in his final rejoinder. In doing this, I'll try to shed light

## Ambridge 2020 & replies

### 100k foot view of target article

exemplars not abstraction

### replies, for, against, and conciliatory

- phonology
- abstraction is necessary
- deep learning as exemplar

## what is abstraction? what are "stored abstractions"?

## Varieties of exemplar models

blabla

### what is "storage"?

yadda

### what is "analogy"? how does it work?

yadda

### what is "similarity"? where does it come from?

## where do NNs fit in?

BERT, ELMo et al

## incommensurability & foundational premises

map/terrain stuff

- Ambridge's point about Adger's example

## what are we (linguists) trying to do here, anyway?

- modeling in phonology (linguistics): Bradfield paper
- science as sense-making vs "explanation"
- Feyerabend
- "let a thousand flowers bloom"
